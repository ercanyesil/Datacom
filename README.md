# Datacom
Our Datacom project is to provide communication between different vlan and switch and router connections between hardware devices over the network.

We created the topology of our project. We have created a general application step order for our project. These:

1. Topology eNSP will also be established.
2. IP assignments and vlan assignments will be created for each device.
3. IP Subnetting will be done.
4. Device and gateway IP plan will be prepared for each Vlan group.
5. Switch vlan configurations will be completed.
6. PC IP configurations will be completed.
7. Gateway IP configuration for VLANs will be completed.
8. IP configurations between routers will be completed.
9. Static routing will be done on routers.


Project Result

In the conclusion part, our ping results below will be completed successfully.
- After step 5, ping operations between PC1 and PC4, PC6 and PC8, PC9 and PC11 should be able to access each other after vlan configuration is completed.

- After step 6, all the different vlans in each section should be pinging each other.

- After step 8, every device in different sections should ping each other.
